# Kubernetes on GKE (Introduction)

This repo contains the code examples used in the live course 
titled 'Kubernetes on GKE', held on the [O'Reilly's platform](https://www.oreilly.com/).

**How To Use Code Examples**

The examples are meant to followed in a _relative_ sequential
fashion, but many of them suggest the set up of 'watchers' or steady
monitoring scripts in different windows/panels/panes/tabs/etc. Others,
instead may require user interaction.

In addition, the comments may suggest further experimentation beyond
the directly executable scripts.
